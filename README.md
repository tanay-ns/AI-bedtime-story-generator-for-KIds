# Hippocratic AI Coding Assignment
Welcome to the [Hippocratic AI](https://www.hippocraticai.com) coding assignment

## Instructions
The attached code is a simple python script skeleton. Your goal is to take any simple bedtime story request and use prompting to tell a story appropriate for ages 5 to 10
- Do not change the openAI model that is being used
- We included an openai api key. Please don't abuse it
- Otherwise, you may change any code you like or add any files

## Rules
- This assignment is open-ended
- You may use any resources you like with the following restrictions
   - They must be resources that would be available to you if you worked here (so no other humans, no closed AIs, no unlicensed code, etc.)
   - Allowed resources include but not limited to Stack overflow, random blogs, chatGPT et al
   - You have to be able to explain how the code works, even if chatGPT wrote it
- DO NOT PUSH THE API KEY TO GITHUB. OpenAI will automatically delete it

## What does "tell a story" mean?
It should be appropriate for ages 5-10. Other than that it's up to you. Here are some ideas to help get the brain-juices flowing!
- Use story arcs to tell better stories
- Allow the user to provide feedback or request changes
- Categorize the request and use a tailored generation strategy for each category
